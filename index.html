    I have always loved movies and can most certainly say that the majority of my personality and my understanding of my sense of self are
    deeply derived from the things I grew up watching. </p>
    <p class="main-text">Unfortunately, Hollywood has historically done a bad job at telling nuanced, or at
      the very least non-reductive, stories about women, people of color, and basically anyone who is not a cis-hetero white man. 
      This project serves as an examination into the stories that influenced (or had the potential to influence) me when I was growing up.

    <h2 class = "heading"> The Bechdel Test</h2>
    </section>
    <p class = "main-text">The Bechdel Test is a way of evaluating whether or not a film or other work of fiction portrays women in a way that is sexist or characterized by gender stereotyping.
      The Bechdel Test is named after American cartoonist <a href="https://dykestowatchoutfor.com/">Allison Bechdel</a> who debuted the metric in her 1985 comic strip <i>Dykes to Watch Out For</i>.
      The Bechdel Test has inspired numerous variations and alterations as ways of discussing marginalized representation in film have evolved in the culture. </p>
    
  <p class = "main-text"> To pass the Bechdel test a work must feature: </p>
  <p class="main-text">
  <li class="main-text"> At least two women </li>
   <li class="main-text"> These women must talk to each other, and  </li>
   <li class="main-text">Their conversation must concern something other than a man.</li>

</section>
<!-- <div class="legend-heading"> * Click a circle to get the movies for that year!</div>

<p class="main-text">This series of visualizations demonstrates how throughout my lifetime, Hollywood has more often invested more in male-dominated storytelling, with higher overall budgets awarded to films that fail the Bechdel test. 
Here, users can observe trends in gender bias from 1997-2013 in how movies were invested in, how much they made, and how many concern stories with multi-dimensional non-male protagonists.
