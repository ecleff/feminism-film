<h1 class="title">Formative Films, Flimsy Representation</h1>
<h2 class = "sub-heading"> Examining the representation of women in movies from my formative years </h3>
<p class = "main-text">I have always loved movies and can most certainly say that the majority of my personality and my understanding of my sense of self are the very least non-reductive, stories about women, people of color, and basically anyone who is not a cis-hetero white man. I wanted to deeply derived from the things I grew up watching. Unfortunately, Hollywood has historically done a bad job at telling nuanced, or at examine the stories that influenced (or had the potential to influence) me when I was growing up.</p>

<h2 class = "heading"> What is the Bechdel test?</h2>
<p class = "main-text">A way of evaluating whether or not a film or other work of fiction portrays women in a way that is sexist or characterized by gender ste- reotyping.
  <p class = "main-text"> To pass the Bechdel test a work must feature: </p>
  <p class="main-text">
  <li> At least two women </li>
   <li> These women must talk to each other, and  </li>
   <li>Their conversation must concern something other than a man.</li>
